## 4. Our Role: Data Processor for Guest Data

When a host uses HeyConcierge to communicate with guests:

- **The host is the data controller** for guest personal data. The host decides to use HeyConcierge and is responsible for their lawful basis to process guest data.
- **HeyConcierge is the data processor.** We process guest data solely on behalf of the host, according to their instructions, and only for the purpose of providing the AI concierge service.

We offer a **Data Processing Agreement (DPA)** to all hosts. Contact hello@heyconcierge.io to request one.

We do not use guest data for our own marketing or sell it to third parties. Guest data is used exclusively to provide the Service.

## 5. Sub-processors

We use the following third-party sub-processors to deliver the Service:

| Sub-processor | Purpose | Location |

| **Stripe** | Payment processing and subscription billing | United States |
| **Vercel** | Application hosting and edge functions | United States / Global |
| **Render** | Backend hosting and infrastructure | United States |

All sub-processors are bound by data processing agreements and maintain appropriate security measures. See Section 8 for international transfer safeguards.

We maintain an up-to-date list of sub-processors and will notify hosts of any material changes.

## 8. International Data Transfers

Some of our sub-processors are located in the United States. When personal data is transferred outside the EEA, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place:

- **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs):** We use EU-approved SCCs with all US-based sub-processors.

We only transfer the minimum data necessary for each sub-processor to perform its function.

## 9. Security Measures

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data, including:

- **Encryption:** Data encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest
- **Access control:** Role-based access; principle of least privilege
- **Authentication:** Secure authentication for all accounts
- **Infrastructure:** Hosted on reputable cloud providers with SOC 2 compliance
- **Monitoring:** Logging and monitoring for unauthorized access attempts
- **Incident response:** Procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to data breaches. We will notify affected hosts and supervisory authorities within 72 hours of becoming aware of a breach, as required by GDPR.

We regularly review and update our security practices.

## 10. Cookies
