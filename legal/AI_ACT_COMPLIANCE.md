## 1. Purpose

## 3. Risk Classification

### 3.1 Assessment

The AI Act establishes four risk tiers: Unacceptable (Art. 5), High-Risk (Art. 6, Annex III), Limited Risk / Transparency Obligations (Art. 50), and Minimal Risk.

**HeyConcierge is classified as a Limited Risk AI system** subject to **transparency obligations under Article 50**.

### 3.2 Why HeyConcierge Is NOT High-Risk

HeyConcierge does **not** fall within any of the high-risk categories listed in Annex III of the AI Act:

| Annex III Category | Applicability | Reasoning |
|---------------------|--------------|-----------|
| 1. Biometrics | ❌ Not applicable | No biometric identification or categorisation |
| 2. Critical infrastructure | ❌ Not applicable | Not used in energy, water, transport, or digital infrastructure |
| 3. Education and vocational training | ❌ Not applicable | No educational assessment or admission decisions |
| 4. Employment, workers management | ❌ Not applicable | No recruitment, evaluation, or workforce management |
| 5. Access to essential services | ❌ Not applicable | No credit scoring, insurance, or social benefit decisions |
| 6. Law enforcement | ❌ Not applicable | No law enforcement use |
| 7. Migration, asylum, border control | ❌ Not applicable | No immigration-related use |
| 8. Administration of justice | ❌ Not applicable | No judicial or democratic process use |

**Additionally:**
- HeyConcierge does not make decisions that produce **legal effects** or **significantly affect** natural persons (Art. 6(2) threshold).
- The system provides **informational responses** only (property information, check-in instructions, local recommendations). It does not make autonomous decisions, approve/deny services, or assess individuals.
- Guests can always contact the host directly for human assistance.

### 3.3 Why Transparency Obligations Apply (Art. 50)

Article 50(1) of the AI Act requires that deployers of AI systems designed to **interact directly with natural persons** ensure that those persons are **informed that they are interacting with an AI system**, unless this is obvious from the circumstances.

HeyConcierge's concierge bot interacts directly with guests via messaging platforms. It is not always obvious to a guest that they are communicating with an AI rather than a human. Therefore, **Article 50 transparency obligations apply**.

---

## 4. Compliance Measures

### 4.1 Transparency (Art. 50)

**Obligation:** Inform persons that they are interacting with an AI system.

**Implementation:**
1. **AI disclosure in bot welcome message** — The concierge bot's initial message to each guest clearly states that it is an AI-powered assistant. Templates are provided in multiple languages (see [AI Disclosure Templates](./AI_DISCLOSURE_TEMPLATES.md)).
2. **Host contractual obligation** — The Terms of Service (Clause 8.1) require hosts to ensure guests are informed they are communicating with an AI-powered service.
3. **Guest privacy notice** — A standard guest privacy notice (see [Guest Privacy Notice](./GUEST_PRIVACY_NOTICE.md)) includes information about AI processing.

### 4.2 General-Purpose AI Model (GPAI) Obligations

HeyConcierge uses Anthropic's Claude, which is a **general-purpose AI model** under Art. 3(63) AI Act. The obligations for GPAI model providers (Art. 53–55) fall on **Anthropic as the provider**, not on HeyConcierge as the deployer.

HeyConcierge's responsibilities as a **deployer** using a GPAI model:
- Use the model in accordance with its intended purpose and Anthropic's usage policies ✅
- Implement appropriate transparency measures for end users ✅
- Monitor for and mitigate foreseeable misuse ✅

### 4.3 No Prohibited Practices (Art. 5)

HeyConcierge does **not** engage in any prohibited AI practices:
- ❌ No subliminal manipulation
- ❌ No exploitation of vulnerabilities (age, disability, social/economic situation)
- ❌ No social scoring
- ❌ No real-time biometric identification
- ❌ No emotion recognition in workplace or education
- ❌ No predictive policing based on profiling

### 4.4 Content Marking (Art. 50(2))

HeyConcierge does not generate synthetic audio, image, video, or text that could be mistaken for authentic human-generated content intended to inform the public about matters of public interest. The AI generates **property-specific informational responses** in a clearly disclosed AI context. Full Art. 50(2) content-marking obligations (e.g., watermarking) are therefore not applicable.
