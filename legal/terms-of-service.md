## 1. Introduction & Acceptance of Terms

Welcome to HeyConcierge ("Service", "Platform", "we", "us"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the HeyConcierge platform operated by HeyConcierge AS, a Norwegian company.

By creating an account or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

These Terms apply to all users of the Platform, including property hosts, property managers, and anyone accessing the Service on their behalf.

## 2. Service Description

HeyConcierge provides an AI-powered concierge service for short-term rental hosts. The Service operates via WhatsApp and allows hosts to automate guest communication by:

- Providing AI-generated responses to guest inquiries based on property information supplied by the host
- Handling common questions about check-in, amenities, local recommendations, and house rules
- Sending automated messages at configurable times (e.g., pre-arrival, checkout reminders)

The Service acts as a tool for the host. The host remains responsible for the accuracy of information provided to the platform and for the overall guest experience.

## 3. Account Registration & Eligibility

To use HeyConcierge, you must:

- Be at least 18 years old
- Provide accurate and complete registration information
- Be authorized to act on behalf of the property or business you register
- Keep your account credentials secure

You are responsible for all activity under your account. Notify us immediately at hello@heyconcierge.io if you suspect unauthorized access.

## 4. Subscription Plans & Payment

HeyConcierge offers subscription plans billed on a monthly basis. Payments are processed securely through Stripe.

- **Billing cycle:** Monthly, starting from the date of subscription
- **Payment method:** Credit/debit card via Stripe
- **Price changes:** We will notify you at least 30 days before any price increase. Continued use after the change constitutes acceptance.
- **Failed payments:** If a payment fails, we may suspend access until the balance is resolved
- **Taxes:** Prices are exclusive of VAT/taxes unless stated otherwise. You are responsible for applicable taxes in your jurisdiction.

Current plans and pricing are available at [heyconcierge.io/pricing](https://heyconcierge.io/pricing).

## 5. Free Trial

We may offer a free trial period for new users. During the trial:

- You get access to the Service with the features described at sign-up
- No payment is required during the trial period
- At the end of the trial, your account will convert to a paid subscription unless you cancel before the trial ends
- We will notify you before the trial expires
- We reserve the right to modify or discontinue free trials at any time

## 6. User Responsibilities

As a user of HeyConcierge, you agree to:

- **Provide accurate property information.** The AI generates responses based on what you tell it. Inaccurate info leads to bad guest experiences — and that's on you.
- **Keep your property details up to date.** Changed the Wi-Fi password? Update it in HeyConcierge.
- **Not use the Service for illegal purposes**, including but not limited to fraud, harassment, discrimination, or any activity that violates applicable laws.
- **Not attempt to reverse-engineer, copy, or misuse** the platform or its underlying technology.
- **Comply with WhatsApp's terms of service** and messaging policies.
- **Respect guest privacy** and handle guest data in accordance with applicable data protection laws (see Section 9).

## 7. AI Disclaimer

HeyConcierge uses artificial intelligence to generate responses to guest inquiries. While we strive for accuracy, **AI is not perfect**.

- **AI-generated responses may contain errors**, inaccuracies, or outdated information.
- **We do not guarantee** the correctness, completeness, or reliability of any AI-generated content.
- **You are responsible** for reviewing the information your AI concierge provides and ensuring it is accurate.
- **HeyConcierge is not liable** for any damages, losses, or inconveniences resulting from incorrect or misleading information provided by the AI to your guests.
- The AI does not replace human judgment. For critical matters (emergencies, legal questions, safety issues), guests should contact the host directly.

We continuously improve our AI, but it operates as a tool — not a replacement for the host's own responsibility.

## 8. Data & Privacy

We take data protection seriously. HeyConcierge is committed to GDPR compliance.

We collect and process personal data as necessary to provide the Service. This includes host account information, property details, and guest communication data processed through the platform.

For full details on what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights, please see our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy.md).

By using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read and understood our Privacy Policy.

## 9. Guest Data Handling

When using HeyConcierge, guest data (such as WhatsApp messages and phone numbers) is processed through our platform.

**Roles and responsibilities:**

- **The host is the data controller.** You determine why and how guest data is processed. You are responsible for having a lawful basis to process your guests' personal data (e.g., performance of a rental contract, legitimate interest).
- **HeyConcierge is the data processor.** We process guest data solely on your behalf and according to your instructions, as described in our Data Processing Agreement (DPA).
- **A DPA is available upon request** at hello@heyconcierge.io. For enterprise customers, we can execute a custom DPA.

As a host, you are responsible for:

- Informing guests that an AI concierge may handle their inquiries
- Ensuring you have a lawful basis to share guest contact information with the Service
- Responding to data subject requests from your guests (we will assist where required)

## 10. Intellectual Property

- **We own the platform.** HeyConcierge, its software, design, branding, AI models (as integrated), and documentation are the intellectual property of HeyConcierge AS or its licensors.
- **You own your content.** Property descriptions, photos, house rules, and other content you upload remain yours.
- **License to us.** By uploading content, you grant HeyConcierge a limited, non-exclusive license to use that content solely for the purpose of providing the Service (e.g., generating AI responses based on your property info).
- **No scraping.** You may not scrape, copy, or reproduce any part of the platform without written permission.

## 11. Service Availability & Uptime

We aim to keep HeyConcierge available 24/7, but we cannot guarantee uninterrupted service.

- **No SLA guarantee** is provided for free or starter-tier plans.
- We may experience downtime due to maintenance, updates, or circumstances beyond our control (including third-party service outages from WhatsApp, hosting providers, or AI providers).
- We will make reasonable efforts to notify users of planned maintenance in advance.
- For enterprise plans, custom SLA agreements may be available — contact us at hello@heyconcierge.io.

HeyConcierge is not liable for any losses arising from service downtime or interruptions.

## 12. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:

- **HeyConcierge's total liability** for any claims arising from your use of the Service shall not exceed the amount you paid to HeyConcierge in the **12 months preceding the claim**.
- **We are not liable** for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of revenue, lost bookings, reputational harm, or guest dissatisfaction.
- **We are not liable** for damages arising from AI-generated content, third-party service failures (WhatsApp, Stripe, etc.), or your failure to keep property information accurate and up to date.

This limitation applies regardless of the legal theory (contract, tort, or otherwise).

Nothing in these Terms excludes liability that cannot be excluded under Norwegian law, including liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct.

## 13. Termination & Cancellation

**You can cancel anytime.** No lock-in, no questions asked.

- Cancel your subscription through your account dashboard or by contacting hello@heyconcierge.io.
- Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period. You retain access until then.
- **No refunds** for partial billing periods, unless required by applicable law.

**Data after cancellation:**

- You may request an export of your data before or within 30 days of cancellation.
- After 30 days, your account data (property info, settings, conversation history) will be permanently deleted.
- Guest message data is handled according to our data retention policy (see Privacy Policy).

**We may terminate your account** if you:

- Violate these Terms
- Use the Service for illegal or harmful purposes
- Fail to pay outstanding invoices after reasonable notice

We will provide notice before termination where practicable, except in cases of serious misconduct.

## 14. Modifications to Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do:

- We will provide at least **30 days' notice** before material changes take effect.
- Notice will be sent via email to your registered address and/or displayed in the platform.
- Continued use of the Service after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
- If you disagree with the changes, you may cancel your subscription before the changes take effect.

## 15. Governing Law & Disputes

These Terms are governed by the laws of **Norway**.

Any disputes arising from or in connection with these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of **Tromsø tingrett** (Tromsø District Court), Norway.

Before initiating legal proceedings, both parties agree to attempt to resolve disputes amicably through good-faith negotiation.
