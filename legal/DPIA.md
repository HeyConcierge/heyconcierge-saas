# Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

**HeyConcierge AI Guest Concierge Service**

**Version 1.0 | February 2026**
**Prepared by:** HeyConcierge AS

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

This Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is conducted pursuant to Article 35 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It assesses the data protection risks associated with HeyConcierge's AI-powered guest concierge service, which uses Anthropic's Claude language model to process guest messages and generate automated responses.

### 1.1 Why This DPIA Is Conducted

Although HeyConcierge acts primarily as a Data Processor (with Hosts as Controllers), we conduct this DPIA proactively because:

- The service involves **systematic processing of personal data** (guest communications) on a potentially large scale;
- Processing involves **new technologies** (large language models / AI);
- The Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) guidelines recommend DPIAs for AI-based processing of personal data.

This DPIA is made available to Hosts to support their own compliance obligations.

## 2. Description of Processing

### 2.1 Overview

HeyConcierge enables property hosts (short-term rental, hotels, guesthouses) to deploy an AI-powered chatbot that answers guest questions via Telegram and WhatsApp. The AI component is powered by Anthropic's Claude API.

### 2.2 Processing Flow

1. **Guest sends a message** via Telegram or WhatsApp to the host's concierge bot.
2. **HeyConcierge receives the message** via the messaging platform's API.
3. **Message is stored** in the HeyConcierge database (Supabase, EU region) for conversation context.
4. **Message content is sent to Anthropic's Claude API** (USA) along with the property's configured context (house rules, FAQs, etc.) to generate a response.
5. **AI-generated response is returned** to the guest via the messaging platform.
6. **Conversation data is retained for 90 days**, then automatically deleted.

### 2.3 Categories of Personal Data

| Category | Data Elements | Source |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Identity data | First name (if provided or visible on messaging platform) | Guest / messaging platform |
| Contact data | Phone number, Telegram user ID, WhatsApp number | Messaging platform |
| Communication content | Text of messages sent by guest | Guest |
| AI-generated responses | Responses generated by Claude based on guest input | Anthropic API |
| Metadata | Timestamps, session IDs, conversation thread IDs | System-generated |

### 2.4 Special Category Data

The service is **not designed** to collect special category data (Art. 9 GDPR). Hosts are contractually prohibited from configuring the bot to elicit such data. However, guests may voluntarily include sensitive information in messages (e.g., mentioning health needs). Such data is processed incidentally and not extracted or categorised.

### 2.5 Data Subjects

Guests of the Host's property — typically adults staying at short-term rental accommodations.

### 2.6 Scale of Processing

- Per host: estimated 10–500 guest conversations per month
- Per conversation: typically 5–30 messages
- Total platform scale at launch: limited (early-stage startup)

---

## 3. Necessity and Proportionality

### 3.1 Purpose and Lawful Basis

**Purpose:** To provide automated, AI-powered responses to guest enquiries about the host's property, improving guest experience and reducing host workload.

**Lawful basis (Controller's perspective):**
- **Legitimate interests** (Art. 6(1)(f)) — the guest initiates contact and reasonably expects a response; or
- **Contract performance** (Art. 6(1)(b)) — where the interaction is part of the accommodation service.

### 3.2 Data Minimisation

- Only data necessary for generating a response is sent to the AI model (current message + recent conversation context + property configuration).
- No guest profile aggregation or behavioural tracking is performed.
- Guest data is not used for marketing, advertising, or model training.
- Conversation data is automatically deleted after 90 days.

### 3.3 Purpose Limitation

Guest data is processed **solely** to operate the concierge service. It is not repurposed for analytics, profiling, or any secondary use.

### 3.4 Storage Limitation

| Data | Retention |
|------|-----------|
| Conversation content | 90 days (auto-deleted) |
| Guest contact identifiers | Deleted with conversation data or on host account termination |
| Host account data | Duration of contract + 2 years |

## 4. Risk Assessment

### 4.1 Risk Matrix

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Severity | Overall | Mitigation |
|---|------|-----------|----------|---------|------------|
| R1 | **Unauthorised access to guest conversations** (data breach) | Low | High | Medium | Encryption at rest/transit, access controls, MFA, monitoring (see §5) |
| R2 | **AI hallucination / inaccurate response** causing guest harm (e.g., wrong emergency info) | Medium | Medium | Medium | System prompts constrain responses to property context; hosts configure content; disclaimer in ToS (see §5) |
| R3 | **International data transfer to Anthropic (USA)** — risk of US government access | Low | Medium | Low-Medium | Standard Contractual Clauses with Anthropic; data transmitted is transient (not stored by Anthropic beyond request processing); Transfer Impact Assessment conducted (see §5) |
| R4 | **Guest unknowingly communicates with AI** (lack of transparency) | Medium | Low-Medium | Medium | Hosts contractually required to inform guests; AI disclosure templates provided; AI Act Art. 50 compliance (see §5) |
| R5 | **Incidental processing of special category data** (guest voluntarily shares health/religion info) | Medium | Medium | Medium | Not designed to collect; not extracted or categorised; system prompt instructs bot to not request sensitive data; 90-day auto-deletion (see §5) |
| R6 | **Anthropic processes data beyond instructions** (sub-processor risk) | Very Low | High | Low | DPA with Anthropic; Anthropic's zero-retention API policy for commercial customers; contractual restrictions (see §5) |
| R7 | **Guest data retained longer than necessary** | Low | Medium | Low | Automated 90-day deletion; account termination triggers 30-day purge (see §5) |
| R8 | **Guest unable to exercise GDPR rights** (access, erasure) | Low | Medium | Low | Host is controller and must respond to DSARs; HeyConcierge assists; direct contact channel available (see §5) |

### 4.2 Severity Assessment Criteria

- **Low:** Minor inconvenience, no lasting impact on data subject
- **Medium:** Significant concern, potential reputational or financial impact on data subject
- **High:** Serious harm — discrimination, identity theft, physical danger

## 5. Mitigation Measures

### 5.1 Technical Measures

| Measure | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Encryption in transit** | TLS 1.2+ for all communications |
| **Encryption at rest** | AES-256 for database storage (Supabase) |
| **Access controls** | Least-privilege access; role-based permissions |

| **Standard Contractual Clauses** | SCCs in place for US-based sub-processors (Anthropic, Vercel, Stripe) |
| **Transfer Impact Assessment** | Conducted for Anthropic transfer; Anthropic does not retain API input/output data for commercial customers |
| **Host contractual obligations** | ToS requires hosts to inform guests about AI use and comply with data protection law |
| **AI disclosure templates** | Ready-made transparency notices in multiple languages provided to hosts |
| **Guest privacy notice** | Standard guest-facing privacy notice provided to hosts |
| **Staff training** | Data protection awareness for all personnel with data access |
| **Incident response plan** | Documented breach notification procedure (24h to controller, 72h to DPA) |

### 5.3 AI-Specific Measures

| Measure | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **System prompt constraints** | Bot is instructed to only answer property-related questions; refuses to provide medical, legal, or emergency advice beyond directing to appropriate services |
| **No model training on guest data** | Contractual prohibition; Anthropic's commercial API terms confirm no training on customer data |
| **No profiling or automated decision-making** | Responses are informational only; no decisions with legal or significant effects on data subjects |
| **Anthropic zero-retention** | Anthropic's commercial API does not retain input/output beyond request processing |
| **Content moderation** | System prompts prevent generation of harmful, discriminatory, or inappropriate content |

## 6. International Transfer Assessment (Anthropic)

### 6.1 Transfer Details

- **Exporter:** HeyConcierge AS (Norway/EEA)
- **Importer:** Anthropic, PBC (USA)
- **Data transferred:** Guest message content (for AI processing only)
- **Safeguard:** Standard Contractual Clauses (Module 3: Processor to Sub-processor)

### 6.2 Transfer Impact Assessment Summary

- **US legal framework:** FISA Section 702 and EO 12333 are relevant surveillance laws. However:
  - Anthropic is not a telecommunications provider and is unlikely to be a direct target of FISA 702 orders for hospitality chatbot data.
  - Data transmitted is transient conversational content (property questions), not high-value intelligence targets.
  - Anthropic does not retain API data for commercial customers beyond request processing.
- **Supplementary measures:** SCCs, encryption in transit, data minimisation (only necessary message context is transmitted), no persistent storage at Anthropic.
- **Conclusion:** The residual risk of US government access to guest conversational data about property check-in times and WiFi passwords is assessed as **very low**.

## 7. Consultation

### 7.1 Internal Review

This DPIA has been reviewed internally by HeyConcierge's founding team.

### 7.2 DPA Consultation

Based on the risk assessment, the residual risks are reduced to an acceptable level through the mitigation measures described above. Prior consultation with the supervisory authority under Article 36 GDPR is therefore not considered necessary at this time.

### 7.3 Availability

This DPIA is made available to:
- Hosts (Data Controllers) upon request
- Datatilsynet (Norwegian DPA) upon request
- Prospective enterprise customers during due diligence

---

## 8. Review Schedule

This DPIA shall be reviewed:
- **Annually** (next review: February 2027)
- When there is a **significant change** to the processing (e.g., new AI model, new data categories, new messaging platforms)
- When a **data breach** occurs that materially changes the risk profile

---

## 9. Conclusion

The HeyConcierge AI concierge service processes a limited set of guest personal data (names, phone numbers, message content) for the clearly defined purpose of answering property-related questions. The use of Anthropic's Claude API introduces an international data transfer to the USA, which is mitigated by SCCs, data minimisation, and Anthropic's zero-retention policy.

The overall residual risk to data subjects is assessed as **low to medium**, and is adequately addressed by the technical and organisational measures described in this DPIA.
