## Privacy Notice — AI Concierge Service

**Who is responsible for your data?**
Your property host ("[Host Name]") is the data controller responsible for the personal data collected when you use this concierge service. The host uses a platform called **HeyConcierge** (HeyConcierge AS, Tromsø, Norway) as a service provider (data processor) to operate the concierge chatbot.

**What data is collected?**
When you interact with the concierge chatbot, the following data is processed:
- Your name (as displayed on the messaging platform)
- Your phone number or messaging platform user ID
- The content of messages you send and receive
- Message timestamps

**What is this data used for?**
Your data is used solely to:
- Answer your questions about the property (check-in/out, house rules, WiFi, local recommendations, etc.)

Your data is **not** used for marketing, profiling, or any other purpose.

**AI processing — Important information**
🤖 This concierge service is powered by **artificial intelligence** (Anthropic's Claude AI model). Your messages are processed by AI to generate responses. No human reads your messages in real time, although the host may review conversation logs for service quality purposes.

Your message content is transmitted to Anthropic, PBC (USA) for AI processing. This transfer is protected by EU Standard Contractual Clauses. Anthropic does not retain your data beyond processing each request.

**How long is my data kept?**
- Conversation data is automatically deleted **90 days** after each message.
- If you would like your data deleted sooner, contact the host or email hello@heyconcierge.io.

Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the right to:
- **Access** your personal data
- **Correct** inaccurate data
- **Delete** your data ("right to be forgotten")

- **HeyConcierge (data processor):** hello@heyconcierge.io
- **Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet):** www.datatilsynet.no

**Legal basis**
The legal basis for processing your data is the legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) of your host in providing you with a responsive concierge service during your stay, or contract performance (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) where the concierge service forms part of your accommodation agreement.
